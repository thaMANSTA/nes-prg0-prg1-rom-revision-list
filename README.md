Donkey Kong Jr. - Fixed so Mario will now walk if the D-pad is held diagonally. Removed that the game will automatically scroll through the menu options while holding the Select button. All fruits remain the same color even if they fall. The chains in stage 4 are brighter to make them stand out better. Fixed Stage 2 vine glitch (if the final vine of Stage 2 is grabbed from the left side, a glitched ending animation will occur: Junior will climb down the vine instead of up, then appear on the final platform).

Kid Niki - Radical Ninja - Unknown.

Sky Shark - Unknown.

Super Mario Bros. + Duck Hunt + World Class Track Meet - Unknown.

Super Mario Bros 2 - Fixed Fryguy glitch (Normally, hitting a mini-Fryguy with a Mushroom Block will cause it to disappear in a puff of smoke. In the original release, however, if you manage to hit one while your character is shrinking, it will flip upside-down and fall off the screen instead.

This somehow confuses the game into thinking there are mini-Fryguys left even after the rest are extinguished, and hence the exit will never appear). Waits a little bit longer with drawing the Bonus Change screen layout to prevent it from failing to render on PAL consoles (even in the NTSC version).

Super Mario Bros 3 - Fixed some grammatical errors, changed Kuribo to Gomba, changed the world names.

Taboo - The Sixth Sense - Unknown.

Tecmo Bowl - A couple player names were changed for Indianapolis. As running back, Eric Dickerson was changed to Albert Bentley; and as kick returner, Albert Bentley was changed to Clarence Verdin. This was due to a legal dispute with Dickerson, whose lawyers claimed he never gave the NFL Players Association (whom Tecmo licensed player names from) permission to use his name and likeness.

Tecmo NBA Basketball - Fixed multiple errors in the player stats. Got a later revision called "NES-N7" that replaced Michael Jordan with a generic faceless character.

Top Gun - Changed the copyright screen.

Track & Field II - The menu is centered and "Olympic" was changed to "Championship".

The Untouchables - It is unknown what the changes are between REV 0 and REV A. REV B however got a totally different title screen, swaps level 2 and 3, and The Border Raid is easier.

Wheel of Fortune - One puzzle got changed from I CAN'T GET NO RELIEF to I DON'T GET NO RESPECT. The former is a line from Bob Dylan's All Along the Watchtower, while the latter was Rodney Dangerfield's catchphrase.
